### Install Dependencies

```
    npm install
```

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
    npm start
```

Now browse to the app at

```
    http://localhost:8000/employeedetails.html
```


## Directory Layout

```
app/                  --> all of the source files for the application
  app.css               --> default stylesheet
  core/                 --> all app specific modules
    version/              --> version related components
      version.js                 --> version module declaration and basic "version" value service
      version_test.js            --> "version" value service tests
      version-directive.js       --> custom directive that returns the current app version
      version-directive_test.js  --> version directive tests
      interpolate-filter.js      --> custom interpolation filter
      interpolate-filter_test.js --> interpolate filter tests
  view1/                --> the view1 view template and logic
    view1.html            --> the partial template
    view1.js              --> the controller logic
    view1_test.js         --> tests of the controller
  view2/                --> the view2 view template and logic
    view2.html            --> the partial template
    view2.js              --> the controller logic
    view2_test.js         --> tests of the controller
  app.js                --> main application module
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
  index-async.html      --> just like index.html, but loads js files asynchronously
e2e-tests/            --> end-to-end tests
  protractor-conf.js    --> Protractor config file
  scenarios.js          --> end-to-end scenarios to be run by Protractor
karma.conf.js         --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
package.json          --> Node.js specific metadata, including development tools dependencies
package-lock.json     --> Npm specific metadata, including versions of installed development tools dependencies
```

## Updating AngularJS and other dependencies

Since the AngularJS framework library code and tools are acquired through package managers (e.g.
npm) you can use these tools to easily update the dependencies. Simply run the preconfigured script:

```
    npm run update-deps
```
